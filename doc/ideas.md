# Ideas

## Train Idea

* Build railways piece by piece
* Connect train stations
* Run trains from station to station
	* Stations have desired inputs and produce outputs
	* Player connects trains to efficiently supply logistics

* Tracks
* Trains
* Stations
* Goods


## Player Challenges

* Terrain creates obstacles that prevent direct path
* Natural chaos evolution as the game evolves

## Player Victory

* High Score

## Player Defeat

* Trains crash into each other?
* Logistic cannot be supplied?

## Game Analogies

* Mini metro / mini motorways games

## Name

* Railway Mayhem

## Train Game

1. Mini Trainways -- Logistics game. Map routes, lay trains, make logistics circuits.
	More complex onboarding experience.
	* Tile placing
	* Trains just "Go", player can control switching mechanisms for left/right/straight/etc.
	* Instant Chaos -- trains spawn automatically
2. Autobattler. Loop through train destinations (basically -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/)
	Simpler onboarding experience. Instant "hook". Basically Dice Heroes 2.


## Design

You control a train network
You can place train tiles with money. Train tiles can be straight, left turn, right turn, or T
Trains will periodically spawn from the trainyard, and automatically move forward
The player places tracks and gets the trains to go to train stations
The player has a permanently decreasing "timer" that is increased when a train successfully reaches a proper station
The player loses if they run out of time OR a train crashes into another train

The core gimmick is an acceleration of urgency as you have to balance multiple trains on the networks getting places without crashing.

I can see lots of improvements and feature creep already, but I think that's the fundamental core of the game.

Bonus features for later
Train Stations have resources that must be deliverable to other train stations
Trains can be upgraded to be longer, faster, or slower
Track hazards
Track maintenance
Train maintenance

In addition to laying tracks, you also lay tiles for the terrain (kindof a tetris // puzzle element to intelligently place things // make a pretty environment)
Biggest problem I can think of is how to make the player not build a gigantic fucking loop; but instead make a giant ball of train spaghetti for ultimate chaos.
